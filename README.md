learning godot. the main issue i'm struggling with at the moment is:
making new instances. when i make a new instance of an object -
the code is shared between them. so if you make two pieces of cheese
and you try to lift one up, because the code is shared it picks up two.
i UNDERSTAND how i'd fix this, but am struggling with implimentation.

TODO:
- move instances of an object individually
- keep track of recipe we're making
- compare to existing dataset of recipes

the idea is to make a fantasy cooking game. your goal is to make different recipes with the newfound foods.
we start off with the simple in universe version of eggs.

TODO:
- simple touch controls
- keep track of recipe we're making
- compare to existing dataset of recipes?
